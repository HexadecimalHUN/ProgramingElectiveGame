PLEASE before usage read this file:
  # First of All:
   The Github repo contains DEV falgged files also. Those are just for later development purposes. 
  # IF you might like to run our game:
   -Decide if you might like to use Windows or Linux platform.
   -If you use IDE run the Linux file for better experience.
      (NOTE: Basically the only diference is that the Linux version is able to use colorcodes!)
