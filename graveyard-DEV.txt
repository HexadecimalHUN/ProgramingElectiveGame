You arrive at the graveyard, here you meet an old man
“Greetings my armored friend, what are you doing out here at this time of the night? Are you here to rob graves hehe?”
>YES or NO

Yes:
“hahaha you’re a funny guy. However on the more serious note, something has happened down in the catacombs. A grave has been opened, you don’t happen to be the man who opened it, do you?” 

No:
“Oh, that is sad. It should be a very profitable business! I have heard that there should be a tomb in the catacombs where a lord is buried, he should have some treasure buried with him. If I was younger I think I would open that grave just to take a look”

“Anyways I am just here to take a look at an old tomb that has been opened as recently as tonight!
It must have been those pesky goblins again! You would think that they would stop their evildoing after their lord died, but I guess not.” says the old man.

The old man walks toward the catacombs. What do you do?
>Follow him
>Look around
>Go back to the Crossroad

Look around:
You see a road that leads out of the graveyard and into a nearby village.

Go back:
You return to the Crossroad.

Follow him:
The old man leads you to the catacombs, inside it you see the grave where you woke up.
“There could be a treasure in here somewhere… by the way who are you? I can’t see your face underneath that helmet of yours”

What do you do?
>Remove helmet
>ignore his question and search the room

Remove helmet:
You remove your helmet, revealing your skull. 
The old man screams in terror and runs out of the catacombs. 
You are now free to search the tomb without the old man.

Ignore and search:
You find a chest hidden behind the coffin, there is a mysterious lock on it. 
[IP Game to unlock chest, if succeeded at 1st try you obtain a potion and a key, if you don’t succeed at the 1st try you only obtain a key]


You leave the catacombs and as you are outside on the graveyard  you spot a road that leads to a nearby village, do you follow it or do you want to return to the crossroad? 

>Follow the road to the village
>Return to the crossroad
