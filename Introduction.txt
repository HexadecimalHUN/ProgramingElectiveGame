You wake up in a dungeon, you don’t know where you are and everything is dark. You are in some sort of box, where the top is loose. 
You can see a small light shining through a crack in the roof of the box.
You push the roof off the box and a flashing light shines into your face. 
You are in a catacomb.
You see a small green goblin looking at you, it starts to yell “HES AWAKE! HES AWAKE!”
suddenly a group of goblins comes down into the catacomb and they all cheer.
“Welcome back from the grave, my lord, I am Rufus your loyal servant” says an old goblin.
Your body feels very fragile and weak, you look down at yourself and discover that you are nothing but a mere skeleton. 
“We have been waiting for you for a long time now, my lord, since the hero came and destroyed our castle and killed you sire. But now you are back and we can start to build your forces of evil once again!” Rufus says.

You get up from your tomb, the box you were in was your grave, how are you alive you’re wondering? What has happened?

You follow the goblins up the stairs and you arrive at a graveyard. It is night. 
The goblins leads you to a ruin of a castle.
“here we are, you might not recognize it in its current state, but this used to be your home, our home. The Hero destroyed it and slaughtered many of us, including you”

As you enter the main hall you are greeted by a goblin holding an armor and a sword.
“Put this on sire, this will protect you from those pesky humans!”

“Now you are ready sire! Come lets gather your forces of evil and take back what was taken from us!” Rufus says as he leads you out of the castle.
“I am sadly too old to tag along with you, but you will do fine by yourself for now.

Outside of the castle there is a road, which you follow, you meet a crossroad. One road leads to the graveyard where you woke up, the other leads to the forest.
