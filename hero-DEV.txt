After the dust has settled and the village has been pillaged you stand with a group of prisoners.
“SIRE! We have captured the hero that crushed our castle and slayed you, we are ready to punish him for his crimes against the Goblin race and the forces of evil!”
Rufus says.

“HANG HIM, HANG HIM!” the goblin army shouts. 
[HANGMAN GAME BEGINS]

Once the hero has been hung you and the goblins celebrate a successful raid, congratulations you have completed the game!
