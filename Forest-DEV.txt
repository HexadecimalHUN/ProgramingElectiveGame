You enter the forest, its dark and gloomy everywhere. 
As you walk along the road you meet a an evil looking cheeky bestard.
“STOP RIGHT THERE EVILDOER! I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO PROCEED!”
-he yells. 
>Leave the forest
>Get closer

Leave the forest:
You return to the crossroad.

After disturbing his chanting successfully his barrier dematerializes and the monk collapses on the ground. You walk towards him. “Don’t kill me, please!” he says as he starts to cry. 
What do you do:

>Kill him
>Let him live

Kill him:
Without doubt in your mind you raise your sword high and slices the monk in half. As his body falls to the ground you notice him dropping a potion on the floor. [drink potion to gain 1 health]

Let him live:
The bandit runs into the forest, you do not know whereto.

You proceed to follow the road out of the forest. There you find a church.
